 Part A - Mark (5 /5)
 -----------------------------
 
 Comments - 1/1
 Indentation/formatted - 1/1
 Naming - 1/1
 Includsion of Readme - 1/1
 Includsion of Reflection - 1/1
 
 Having reviewed my work according to the detailed rubric, in relation to naming,
 commenting, indentation, and submitting my readme and reflection I have complete 5 of
 these fully. I am recording 5/5
 
 Part B - Mark (2 /2)
 -----------------------------
 
 Sizing - 1/1
 Positioning - 1/1
 I have sized and positioned the display window correctly, so 2/2
 
 Part C - Mark (5 /5)
 -----------------------------
 
 line 11 - setup()
 line 71 - draw()
 
 Setup and draw both used and fully working for me. Line numbers shown, so I score myself excellent 100%. 5/5
 
 Part D - Mark (6 /10)
 -----------------------------
 
 Use of if statements:
 -line 41 and 59 used inside loops to draw chessboard pattern from Shape A and B (modulo condition is tested)
 -line 79 and 85 shows if statenents used within mouse events
 
 I have multiple if statements, with multiple branches. I didn’t use a nested if, but I used
 if statements inside loops and mouse events.
 This falls inside the very good range (60%), so I am scoring 6/10
 
 Part E - Mark (20 /20)
 -----------------------------
 
 Use of loops:
 -I have for loops in my code at lines 27, 109.
 -I have while loop in my code at line 19.
 -I have for loop inside of Recursion bespoke method at line 216.
 -Nesting is demonstrated
 on lines 37, 55, 117, 135 where I have a for inside a for.
 
 I have examples of for, while and nested loops.
 I’m recording an excellent mark for this 100%, so 20/20.
 
 Part F - Mark (20 /20)
 -----------------------------
 
 Use of bespoke methods:
 I have 6 bespoke methods at lines 153, 171, 191, 196, 203, 212. They are called in lines 43(141), 47(145), 2, 3,
 73, 92.
 -Lines 153 and 171 show an overloaded method with 3 parameters and no return value.
 -Lines 191 and 196 show methods with 1 parameter and a return value.
 -Line 203 shows a method with no parameters and no return value.
 -Line 212 shows a recursion method with 2 parameters and no return value.
 
 3+ bespoke methods used, showing examples of different types of bespoke
 methods (no parameters, takes parameters, return value, no return value, recursion). Line numbers shown.
 Hence, I am recording an excellent mark for this (100%).
 
 Part G - Mark (10 /10)
 -----------------------------
 
 Use of processing methods:
 >4 different Processing methods used (size(),background(),stroke(),line(),square(),text(),fill(),random())
 at lines 13, 15, 20, 21, 173, 206, 205, 43.
 Line numbers shown. I’m recording an excellent mark for this (100%)
 
 Part H - Mark (8 /10)
 -----------------------------
 
 Use of mouse methods:
 -mousePressed() with if statements and mouse events at line 77.
 -mouseDragged() at line 91.
 -mouseReleased() at line 96 instead of using mouse events in draw()
 
 I have used 3 Mouse methods. Line numbers shown.
 
 I’m recording an excellent for this (80%)
 
 Part I - Mark (5 /10)
 -----------------------------
 
 I have used 2 String methods (toUpperCase() and toLowerCase()) at lines 81 and 86.
 I’m recording a good mark for this. 50%
 
 Part J - Mark (3 /3)
 -----------------------------
 
 My program saves the display in a PNG file on a right mouse click (100%).
 
 Part K - Mark (5 /5)
 -----------------------------
 
 I have a really nice-looking final image based on the theme of a regular chessboard like grid.
 The cell contents uses colours and randomness,
 text, shapes overlayed on each other. A set of beautiful lines create a feel of light.
 It’s also interactive – if you right click the mouse a text will be shown and randomness removed
 in squares size. Every time the mouse is released the diagonal lines will open wider.
 If you drag the mouse a square will be drawn and cleared on release.
 I will be printing it on my t-shirt!
